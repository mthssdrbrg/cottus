Cottus, named after one of the Hecatonchires of Greek mythology, is a multi limb
HTTP client that currently wraps HTTParty, and manages requests against several
hosts.

This is useful for example when you have internal HTTP-based services running in
EC2 and don't want to use an ELB (as this forces the service to be public) nor
setup HAProxy or any other load-balancing solution.

By default, Cottus will apply a round robin strategy, but you could very well
define your own strategy.

## Installation

```
gem install cottus
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'cottus'

client = Cottus::Client.new(['http://n1.com', 'http://n2.com', 'http://n3.com'])

# This request will be made against http://n1.com
response = client.get('/any/path', query: {id: 1337})
puts response.body, response.code, response.message, response.headers.inspect

# This request will be made against http://n2.com
response = client.post('/any/path', query: {id: 1337}, body: { attribute: 'cool'})
puts response.body, response.code, response.message, response.headers.inspect
```

That's about it! Cottus exposes almost all of the same methods with the same semantics as
HTTParty does, with the exception of ```HTTParty#copy```.

## Strategy

A "Strategy" is merely a class implementing an ```execute``` method that is
responsible for carrying out the action specified by the passed ```meth```
argument.

The Strategy class must however also implement an ```#initialize``` method which
takes three parameters: ```hosts```, ```client``` and an ```options``` hash:

```ruby
class SomeStrategy
  def initialize(hosts, client, options={})
  end

  def execute(meth, path, options={}, &block)
    # do something funky here
  end
end
```

If you don't mind inheritance there's a base class (```Cottus::Strategy```) that
you can inherit from and the above class would instead become:

```ruby
class SomeStrategy < Strategy
  def execute(meth, path, options={}, &block)
    # do something funky here
  end
end
```

If you'd like to do some initialization on your own and override
```#initialize``` make sure to call ```#super``` or set the required instance
variables (```@hosts```, ```@client```) on your own.

It should be noted that I haven't decided on how strategies should be working to
a 100% yet, so this might change in future releases.

See ```lib/cottus/strategies.rb``` for further examples.
