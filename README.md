Cottus, a multi limp HTTP client with an aim of making the use of multiple hosts
providing the same service easier with regards to timeouts and automatic fail-over.

Sure enough, if you don't mind using an ELB in EC2 and making your service public,
or setting up something like HAProxy, then this is not a client library for you.

Initialize a client with a list of hosts and it will happily round-robin load-balance
requests among them.
You could very well define your own strategy if you feel like it and inject it
into Cottus, more on that further down.

## Installation

```
gem install cottus
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'cottus'

client = Cottus::Client.new(['http://n1.com', 'http://n2.com', 'http://n3.com'])

# This request will be made against http://n1.com
response = client.get('/any/path', :query => {:id => 1337})
puts response.body, response.code, response.message, response.headers.inspect

# This request will be made against http://n2.com
response = client.post('/any/path', :query => {:id => 1337}, :body => { :attribute => 'cool'})
puts response.body, response.code, response.message, response.headers.inspect
```

That's about it! Cottus exposes almost all of the same methods with the same semantics as
HTTParty does, with the exception of ```HTTParty#copy```.

## Strategy

A "Strategy" is merely a class implementing an ```execute``` method that is
responsible for carrying out the action specified by the passed ```meth```
argument.

The Strategy class must however also implement an ```#initialize``` method which
takes three parameters: ```hosts```, ```client``` and an ```options``` hash:

```ruby
class SomeStrategy
  def initialize(hosts, client, options={})
  end

  def execute(meth, path, options={}, &block)
    # do something funky here
  end
end
```

If you don't mind inheritance there's a base class (```Cottus::Strategy```) that
you can inherit from and the above class would instead become:

```ruby
class SomeStrategy < Strategy
  def execute(meth, path, options={}, &block)
    # do something funky here
  end
end
```

If you'd like to do some initialization on your own and override
```#initialize``` make sure to call ```#super``` or set the required instance
variables (```@hosts```, ```@client```) on your own.

It should be noted that I haven't decided on how strategies should be working to
a 100% yet, so this might change in future releases.

See ```lib/cottus/strategies.rb``` for further examples.

### Using your own strategy

In order to use your own Strategy class, supply the name of the class in the
options hash as you create your instance, as such:

```ruby
require 'cottus'

client = Cottus::Client.new(['http://n1.com', 'http://n2.com'], :strategy => MyStrategy)
```

Want some additional options passed when your strategy is initialized?

No problem! Pass them into the ```strategy_options``` sub-hash of the options
hash to the client.

```ruby
require 'cottus'

options = {
  :strategy => MyStrategy,
  :strategy_options => {
    :an_option => 'cool stuff!'
  }
}

client = Cottus::Client.new(['http://n1.com', 'http://n2.com'], options)
```

The options will be passed as an options hash to the strategy, as explained
above.

Boom! That's all there is, for the moment.

## cottus?

Cottus was one of the Hecatonchires of Greek mythology.
The Hecatonchires, "Hundred-Handed Ones" (also with 50 heads) were figures in an
archaic stage of Greek mythology.
Three giants of incredible strength and ferocity that surpassed that of all Titans whom they helped overthrow.
